# About Me

I'm a **Computer Vision Engineer** with a strong foundation in mathematics and research, currently working in the **Avatar Team at [Colossyan](https://www.colossyan.com/)**. My work bridges the gap between cutting-edge machine learning research and scalable, real-world applications.

I specialize in:

- **3D Reconstruction**
- **Dynamic Gaussian Splatting**
- **Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)**
- **Motion Blur Reduction**
- **Generative AI and Avatar Systems**

### ðŸ”¬ Research & Collaboration

At the **Intelligent Machines Lab (ITU Lahore)**, Iâ€™ve collaborated with **ETRI South Korea** to tackle motion blur in dynamic 3D scenes and contribute to smoother mesh generation from volumetric NeRF data. My research is published in high-impact venues including:

- **IEEE Access**
- **Multimedia Tools and Applications**

### ðŸ§  Technical Background

I have experience building and deploying machine learning systems end-to-end, with a focus on research-grade performance and production-level robustness. My core technical skills include:

- **Programming**: Python, PyTorch, TorchScript, OpenCV, C++, CUDA, STL
- **Technologies**: Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Multi-View Geometry, 3D Vision
- **DevOps & Cloud**: AWS (S3, Lambda, SageMaker), Docker, GitHub Actions, ArgoWorkflows
- **Other Tools**: Scikit-learn, Flask, Matplotlib

### ðŸ’¼ Experience

- **Machine Learning Engineer** @ Colossyan (2024 â€“ Present)  
  Working on the Avatar team to improve generation pipelines and backend tooling.

- **Research Intern / Associate** @ Intelligent Machines Lab, ITU (2022 â€“ Present)  
  Developed NeRF-based systems, worked on motion blur reduction in 3D Gaussian Splatting.

- **Computer Vision Engineer** @ DeepGears (2021)  
  Created 3D pose estimation and mesh reconstruction systems for AR applications.

- **Research Assistant** @ NCAI, PUCIT (2020)  
  Worked on LiDAR-based object detection for autonomous vehicles.

### ðŸ“‚ Open-Source Projects

- [Codebase for R-CNN](https://github.com/UsamaHasan/Codebase-for-RCNN):  
  An object detection framework inspired by Detectron2 and MMDetection.

- [AEPI: Ear Recognition](https://github.com/UsamaHasan/AEPI-Automated-Ear-Pinna-Identification):  
  A biometric recognition project using deep learning on ear images.

I'm always looking to connect with researchers, engineers, and innovators. Feel free to reach out or check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/UsamaHasan) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/usama-hasan/) for more.
